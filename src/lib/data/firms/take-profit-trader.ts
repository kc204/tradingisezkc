    briefDescription: 'Futures prop firm with a 1-step evaluation, daily payouts, and a path to a live PRO+ account with a 90% profit split.',
    fullReview: `Take Profit Trader (TPT) offers a direct route for futures traders with its 1-step evaluation. Upon passing the Test account, which utilizes a flexible End-of-Day (EOD) trailing drawdown, traders pay a one-time $130 activation fee to get a PRO account. PRO accounts are notable for offering daily payouts from the very first day and an 80% profit split. However, they switch to a more restrictive intraday trailing drawdown based on peak balance. For traders seeking a higher 90% profit share and a return to the EOD drawdown, an upgrade to a PRO+ account is available, which operates in a live market environment. A critical rule for funded traders is the restriction on trading during major news events in both PRO and PRO+ accounts.`,
