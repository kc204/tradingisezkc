    briefDescription: 'A pioneering CFD prop firm from the Czech Republic offering 2-step evaluations with no consistency rules and a scaling plan up to $2M.',
    fullReview: 'FTMO is one of the most recognized names in the prop trading industry, established in 2015. They offer a robust 2-step evaluation process (Challenge and Verification) for CFD traders. Key advantages include the absence of consistency rules, a wide range of tradable assets, and a clear scaling plan that can increase a trader\'s capital to $2M and their profit split to 90%. They provide traders with popular platforms like MT4, MT5, and cTrader. While news trading is restricted on standard funded accounts, they offer a "Swing" account type that allows holding trades over weekends and during news events, providing flexibility for different trading styles.',
