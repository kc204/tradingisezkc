    briefDescription: 'Futures prop firm with multiple plans including Advanced (Intraday DD), Growth (EOD DD), and Straight to Sim Funded accounts.', 
    fullReview: `Tradeify offers several distinct paths for futures traders, catering to different risk tolerances and preferences. Their programs are built on the NinjaTrader brokerage and support NinjaTrader, TradingView, and Tradovate platforms. Payouts are handled via Plane and Riseworks. The main funding routes are the Advanced Plan, Growth Plan, and a Straight to Sim Funded option. The Advanced and Growth plans are 1-step evaluations with a 35% consistency rule, but differ in their drawdown models (Intraday vs. End-of-Day). The Straight to Sim plan allows traders to bypass evaluation for a one-time fee, but comes with a stricter 20% consistency rule and requires achieving specific profit goals before payouts. Across all funded accounts, traders can keep 100% of their first $15,000 in profits, after which the split is 90/10. Tradeify has specific rules regarding EAs/bots (must be self-owned, no HFT), microscalping (50% of profit from trades > 5 seconds), and allows for news trading and copy trading between a trader's own accounts.`,
