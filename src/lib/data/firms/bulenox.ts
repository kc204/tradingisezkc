    briefDescription: 'Futures prop firm with a Qualification to Master account path, choice of drawdown models, and a 100% profit split on the first $10,000.',
    fullReview: `Bulenox provides a structured career path for futures traders, starting with a Qualification Account and progressing to a Master Account. A key differentiator is the choice between two evaluation models: a "No Scaling" account with a trailing drawdown and no daily loss limit, or an "EOD" account with an end-of-day drawdown, a daily loss limit, and a contract scaling plan. After a minimum of 5 trading days, successful traders pay a one-time activation fee to receive a Master Account. This funded account features a 100% profit split on the first $10,000, after which the split becomes 90/10. Traders who demonstrate consistent success on a Master Account may be invited to trade a real capital funded account.`,
    tradingRules: `<h3>Step 1: The Qualification Account</h3>
<p>This is the first step for all traders. The goal is to prove your trading skill by meeting a profit target without breaking any rules.</p>
<h4>Choose Your Trading Style: Account Options</h4>
<p>You must choose one of two account types for your qualification.</p>
<h5>Option 1: No Scaling Account</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Drawdown Type:</strong> Trailing Drawdown.</li>
  <li><strong>How it Works:</strong> Your maximum loss level follows your highest achieved account balance. For example, if your $100k account reaches a balance of $101,000, your new liquidation level becomes $98,000 (with a $3k drawdown). This level stops trailing up once it reaches your initial starting balance.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Feature:</strong> No Daily Loss Limit.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Option 2: EOD (End-of-Day) Account</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Drawdown Type:</strong> End-of-Day Drawdown.</li>
  <li><strong>How it Works:</strong> Your maximum loss level is only adjusted at the end of the trading day (5:00 PM CT), not during live trades.</li>
  <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> This account includes both a Daily Loss Limit (which suspends, but doesn't break, the account for the day if hit) and a Scaling Plan, where the number of contracts you can trade increases as your account balance grows.</li>
</ul>
<h4>General Rules for Qualification</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Minimum Trading Days:</strong> You must trade for at least 5 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple Accounts:</strong> You can have multiple qualification accounts.</li>
  <li><strong>Account Reset:</strong> If you break a rule, you can pay a fee to reset your account and try again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: The Master Account (First Level of Funding)</h3>
<p>After passing the qualification, you advance to a Master Account.</p>
<h4>Transition & Activation</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Process:</strong> After passing, your account is reviewed. You will then sign a contract and other documents to activate your Master Account.</li>
  <li><strong>Fee:</strong> There is no monthly subscription. Instead, you pay a one-time activation fee that varies by account size (e.g., $248 for a $100k account).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Master Account Rules</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No Resets:</strong> You cannot reset a Master Account. If you break a rule, the account is closed.</li>
  <li><strong>Drawdown:</strong> The drawdown rule (Trailing or EOD) continues from your qualification, but it stops moving up once your account balance is $100 above the starting balance.</li>
  <li><strong>Multiple Accounts:</strong> You can have up to 11 active Master Accounts, but you may need to meet certain performance milestones to activate more than three.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: The Funded Account (Real Capital)</h3>
<p>This is the final stage, where consistent traders may be invited to trade real capital.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> A trader with three successful payouts from a Master Account may be invited to transition to a Funded Account at the discretion of the Risk Management team.</li>
    <li><strong>Account Consolidation:</strong> All of a trader's active Master Accounts are merged into a single Funded Account.</li>
    <li><strong>Payout Request:</strong> You must complete at least five individual trading days before requesting a payout.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Trading Policies & Warnings</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Market Halts:</strong> Trading during market halts is high-risk. Bulenox is not responsible for software interruptions, delays, or data feed errors that may occur during these periods.</li>
    <li><strong>Holding Positions:</strong> You are generally required to close all positions before 3:59 PM CST. Holding positions overnight is not permitted, except on the specific $10,000 account.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> If you experience technical problems, you must contact the support team immediately with a detailed description of the issue.</li>
</ul>`,
    payoutRules: `<h4>Payouts & Withdrawals</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Profit Split:</strong> You keep 100% of the first $10,000 you make. After that, the profit split is 90% for you and 10% for Bulenox.</li>
  <li><strong>First Withdrawal:</strong> You need at least 10 active trading days before your first payout request.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency Rule:</strong> No single trading day can represent more than 40% of your total profit.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdrawal Limits:</strong> For your first three payouts, there are maximum withdrawal amounts to encourage account stability. These limits are removed after the third payout.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety Reserve:</strong> A minimum account balance (safety reserve) must be maintained to make a withdrawal.</li>
