    briefDescription: 'A popular futures prop firm offering a 1-Step Evaluation with no daily loss limit and a 100% profit split.',
    fullReview: 'Apex Trader Funding is a prominent firm in the futures trading space, known for its straightforward 1-Step Evaluation process. A key attraction is the absence of a daily drawdown limit, giving traders more flexibility. They offer a 100% profit split for all traders. To qualify for a payout, traders must meet a 30% consistency rule, ensuring that no single day\'s profit dominates their total earnings. The firm supports a vast array of trading platforms compatible with Rithmic and Tradovate, and has specific rules around contract scaling and risk management to guide traders.',

<h3>Commissions</h3>
<p>Commission details are provided on the firm's support pages, with rates varying for Rithmic and Tradovate.</p>
<h3>Firm Rules</h3>
<h4>Consistency Rules</h4>
<p>When requesting a payout from a Performance Account (PA), no single trading day can account for more than 30% of the total accumulated profit balance.</p>
<h4>General Firm Rules</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Inconsistent Sizing:</strong> Drastic changes in trade sizes are not allowed; traders must be consistent.</li>
  <li><strong>Contract Scaling:</strong> Traders can only use half of their maximum allowed contracts until the account balance surpasses the initial trailing threshold stop.</li>
  <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> A maximum risk-to-reward ratio of 5:1 is applied to all trades.</li>
  <li><strong>Limit on Losses:</strong> Open trades must not have a negative drawdown exceeding 30% of the account's profit balance. This limit may be increased to 50% if the account balance doubles the safety net.</li>
  <li><strong>One-Direction Rule:</strong> During a news event, a trader can only hold a long (buy) or short (sell) position, not both simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consequences for Rule Violations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Temporary cap on contract usage (e.g., 50%).</li>
  <li>Payouts may be restricted to only the profit earned since the last payout request.</li>
  <li>Disqualification of "windfall" profits for withdrawal over the next two payout cycles.</li>
</ul>`,
    payoutRules: `<h3>Payout Policy</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Safety Net:</strong> For the first three payouts, the account balance must be equal to the account's drawdown amount plus an extra $100. This rule is removed after the third successful payout.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimum Payout:</strong> If the safety net is met, the minimum payout request is $500.</li>
  <li><strong>Payout Requirements:</strong> To be eligible for a payout, a trader must have at least 8 active trading days, and at least 5 of those days must have a profit of $50 or more.</li>
</ul>`,
