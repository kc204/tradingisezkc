    briefDescription: 'Futures firm from the UAE offering 1-step evaluations and direct funding with a 90% profit split.',
    fullReview: `FundingTicks, based in the United Arab Emirates, presents two primary funding paths for futures traders: a "Pro+" 1-step evaluation and a "Zero" direct-to-funded plan. Both routes offer a generous 90% profit split and utilize an End-of-Day trailing drawdown, a feature favored by many traders for its flexibility. The firm operates on the Tradovate brokerage, providing access to popular platforms like NinjaTrader and TradingView. For those preferring an evaluation, the Pro+ plan requires trading for a minimum of 5 qualifying days to pass. While news trading is allowed during evaluation, it becomes restricted in the funded Master account. Payouts from a Master account can be requested every 5 trading days. The Zero plan allows traders to bypass evaluation for a one-time fee, moving directly to a simulated funded account. This path has a stricter consistency rule (25%) and a payout structure based on hitting specific "Reward Targets." Payouts can be requested every 7 days. A notable rule for Zero accounts is that only EAs that function as risk managers are permitted, and inactivity for 7 days leads to account suspension.`,
