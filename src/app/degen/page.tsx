          Strap in, space cadet! This is where we dive deep into the crypto abyss. Unfiltered alpha, high-risk plays, and maybe a few 100x gems (or complete rugs). Remember: NFA, DYOR, and don't ape what you can't afford to lose! We're all just degens trying to make it.

          This entire Degen Zone is for entertainment and informational novelty ONLY.
          None of this is financial advice (NFA). Cryptocurrencies, especially memecoins and new projects, are EXTREMELY volatile and high-risk.
          You WILL likely lose money. Do Your Own Research (DYOR). Never invest more than you are willing to lose completely.
          We are not responsible for your financial decisions, gains, or (most likely) losses. Ape responsibly... or don't, but don't blame us. WAGMI? Maybe.
