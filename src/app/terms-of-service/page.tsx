           <p>At TradingisEZ, our mission is to provide traders with valuable, unbiased information and resources to help them succeed. To support our work and keep our content free, we participate in affiliate marketing programs. Throughout our website, you may find links to third-party products and services (such as proprietary trading firms, trading tools, courses, etc.). These links may be affiliate links. This means that if you click on one of these links and subsequently make a purchase or sign up for a service on the third-party website, we may receive a small commission or referral fee. This comes at <strong>no additional cost to you</strong>.</p>
           <p>Using our affiliate links helps support TradingisEZ, allowing us to continue creating high-quality content. Our reviews, comparisons, and recommendations are based on thorough research, analysis, and experience. While we may receive compensation, this does not influence our editorial content. We only recommend products and services that we believe will provide value to our readers. The trust of our audience is paramount.</p>
           <p>The Website may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by TradingisEZ. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that TradingisEZ shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>

          <p>We do not require user accounts to use our Website. However, like most website operators, we may collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We may also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
          <p>A cookie is a small file of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons) to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of the Website, and their website access preferences. Our affiliate partners also use cookies to track referrals from our Website.

          <p>The security of your information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Children's Privacy</h3>
          <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 18 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
